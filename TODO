TODO

- Graceful early out if systemd is not running
- Augment failed service journal frags with Message Catalog entries
  o See 'Message Catalog Developer Documentation'
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/catalog
      (see also 'journalctl -x')
  o warn non-root users if not members of systemd-journal group
- Inspect some other Unit types; mounts, targets etc.
- Abbreviated inspection by default (errors), -v for much more data (info)
- systemd help text in output, not just code comments (e.g. 'run systemctl foo to bar' etc.)
- Coloured output
