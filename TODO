TODO

- Graceful early out if systemd is not running
- Aid diagnosis of failed services by reading out relevant journal frags (no dbus for this, see python3-systemd bindings)
- Inspect some other Unit types; mounts, targets etc.
- Abbreviated inspection by default (errors), -v for much more data (info)
- systemd help text in output, not just code comments (e.g. 'run systemctl foo to bar' etc.)
- Coloured output
